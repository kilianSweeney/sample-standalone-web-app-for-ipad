This is a javascript app I built as a conference sales tool. It was used on iPads and large touchscreen monitors. Though it is a web app, it had to be completely available offline so it employs a cache manifest and other html features that provide a native app feel to what is essentially a website.

I put this up on github to display my expertise with javascript, html5, css3, touch device development, ux/ui, design etc...

Check it out on Github Pages:
